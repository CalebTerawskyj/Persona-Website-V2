# Personal Portfolio & Digital Garden 🌱 (v2.0)

Welcome to the source code for version 2.0 of my personal corner of the internet. This project serves as a portfolio, a blog, and a sandbox for my ongoing experiments in web development and infrastructure.

This site is a living document. As I dive deeper into security, network administration, and technical leadership, I treat this repo as a testing ground. Features are added, refactored, or deprecated as my understanding evolves. It’s not just about having a website; it’s about having a place to break things safely.

## 🚀 The Tech Stack

For V2, I prioritized performance and maintainability, choosing a stack that allows for rapid iteration without the bloat.

### Astro

Chosen for its "content-first" philosophy and ability to ship zero JavaScript by default. It allows me to build a high-performance site that feels static but acts dynamic.

### Tailwind CSS

My go-to for styling. It allows me to maintain a consistent design system and rapid-prototype layouts without fighting against the cascade.

## 🔄 The Evolution from V1

This project is a complete architectural overhaul of my original portfolio built in 2025. While V1 started its life as a standard Astro boilerplate to help me learn the ropes, V2 is a ground-up rebuild.

I’ve refactored the core layout, stripped out the defaults, and engineered custom components to fit my specific needs. It is a practical exercise in taking what I learned from my first codebase, understanding its constraints, and rebuilding it to a much higher standard.

## Who is behind the commit history?

I'm Caleb, an IT professional and aspiring technical leader based in Australia 🇦🇺.

If you see something broken, I'm probably in the middle of fixing it (or I broke it while trying to make it faster).
